# foundry-faserip
A FASERIP-like rules system for Foundry VTT.

Warning: I've written this to support my own home games, not as a polished product for general public use. If you want to use it yourself, or fork it to suit your needs, feel free, but I can't promise it's bug-free.

I've written this with [Advanced FASERIP](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/462478/advanced-faserip) in mind, but you might be able to use it with similar systems.
